# Practice-of-Operating-System
This repository contains all homeworks and solutions for Practice-of-Operating-System course in Peking University.

Some solutions may be invalid due to different versions of kernel code. 

And for some tasks I provide several solutions, maybe some of them is incorrect (those are just experimental versions). So be careful when using them, test them with your own kernel first!
