# Operating-System
This repository contains all homeworks and solutions of operating-system practice course in Peking University.
Some solutions may be incorrect due to different versions of kernel code. 
And for some tasks I provide several solutios, maybe some of them is incorrect (those are just experimental versions). So be careful when using them, test them with your own kernel first!
